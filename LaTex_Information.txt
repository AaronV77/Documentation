This is a helpful document for LaTex.

    Classes:
        documentclass:
            Types:
                - article: for articles in scientific
                - IEEEtran: for articles with the IEEE Transactions format.
                - proc: a class for proceedings based on the article class.
                - report: for longer reports containing severeal chapters, small books, thesis.
                - book: for real books
                - slides: for slides, this class will use big sans serif letters.
                - memoir: for changing sensibly the output of the document. It is based on the bookclass, but you can create any kind of document with it.
                - letter: for writing letters.
                - beamer: for writitng presentations.
           
            Options:
                - 10pt: Sets the size of the main font in the document. If no option is specified, 10pt is assumed.
                - a4papper, letterpapper: Defines the paper size. The default size is letterpaper.
                - fleqn: Typesets displayed formulas left-aligned instead of centered.
                - leqno: Places the numbering of formulas on the left hand side instead of the right.
                - titlepage, notitlepage: Specifies whether a new page should be started after the document title or not. 
                The article class does not start a new page by default, while report and book do.
                - twocolumn: Instructs LaTeX to typeset the document in two columns instead of one.
                - twoside, oneside: Specifies whether double or single sided output should be generated. The classes 
                article and report are single sided and the book class is double sided by default. Note that this option 
                concerns the style of the document only. The option twoside does not tell the printer you use that it should 
                actually make a two-sided printout.
                - landscape: Changes the layout of the document to print in landscape mode.
                - openright, openany: Makes chapters begin either only on right hand pages or on the next page available. 
                This does not work with the article class, as it does not know about chapters. The report class by default starts 
                chapters on the next page available and the book class starts them on right hand pages.
                - draft: Makes LaTeX indicate hyphenation and justification problems with a small square in the right-hand margin 
                of the problem line so they can be located quickly by a human. It also suppresses the inclusion of images and shows 
                only a frame where they would normally occur.

            Examples:
                - \documentclass{article}
                - \documentclass[11pt,a4papper]{article}
    
    Commands:
        \being{document}    - The start of what ever is between the two curly braces.
        \end{document}      - The end of the document or whatever class you initialized at the top of your paper.

        \noindent           - Will unindent the default indentation done by LaTex.
        \indent             - Will indent with four spaces.
        \title{...}         - Will create a title for the paper.
        \maketitle          - Usually goes at the very bottom of all your title stuff. This provides default configurations for a title page.
        \chapter            - Will create a section for a chapter in a book and report only document.
        \section            - Will create a section for content.
        \subsection         - Will create a sub-section for content.
        \subsubsection      - Will create a sub-sub-section for content.
        \paragraph          - Will create a paragraph.
        \subparagraph       - Will create a sub-paragraph.

    Special Characters:
        \\      - This will create a newline, but also having an empty line between two lines will create the same effect.
        %       - This the starting character for comments.

    Examples:
        Ex-1:
            \title{How to Structure a LaTeX Document}
            \author{Andrew Roberts}
            \date{December 2004}
            \maketitle

    Notes:
        - The area between \documentclass{...} and \begin{document} is called the preamble. It normally contains commands that affect the entire
        document. After the preamble, the text of your document is enclosed betweeen two commands which identify the beginning an eend of the actual
        document.
