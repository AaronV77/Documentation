These scripts are for working with the Lustre File system. These are only
ment to setup the basics for a Lustre Server and Client. If you end up using
these then you will have to still mount the servers inorder to setup the
system. The same is applied for the clients. Please see the word documentation
inorder to see how to properly start / finish setting up a Lustre File System.
