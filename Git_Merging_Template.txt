When working with issues in a repository:

    - Make sure that master is up-to-date on your machine.
    - Create a new branch off of the master branch.
        - Type: git checkout -b "The Branch Name"
    - Move over to the new branch.
        - Type: git checkout "The Branch Name"
    - Make your changes or bug fixes.

    - If you are working on your own branch for a big team and master is getting
    updated daily or weekly, then you have to make sure that your branch is staying
    up-to-date with master. The reason for this is because at the time you created
    your branch off of master, and to the time when you merge your changes back
    into master, the master branch could have changed since then. So it is good 
    practice to move onto your master branch, update it, switch back to your branch,
    and merge the new master changes into your branch, before you merge your changes
    into master. Make sure to re-test your code to see if it is still working,
    even with the new master changes. Doing this will make sure that your code is 
    working correctly with the new changes, and will make a seemless intergration of
    your changes onto the master branch. The commands are listed below:

        Try this before pushing: git remote set-url origin https://github.com/RemiB/myrepo.git
        When pushing your commits to the new branch do the following: git push origin "branch" or git push --set-upstream origin <branch>

        Type: git checkout master
        Type: git pull
        Type: git checkout "The Branch Name"
        Type: git merge master

    - Switch back over to the master branch.
        - Type: git checkout master
    - Merge the changes of the branch that you created.
        - Type: git merge "The Branch Name"
    - Then delete the branch.
        - Type: git branch -d "The Branch Name"
