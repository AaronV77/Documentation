The inforamtion that is in this file is for working with the coreutils repository. The 
following information will be done on Ubuntu 16.04. 


    Install the following packages in order to compile the packages:

        sudo apt-get install autoconf
        sudo apt-get install autopoint
        sudo apt-get install flex
        sudo apt-get install bison
        sudo apt-get install gperf
        sudo apt-get install makeinfo
        sudo apt-get install texinfo
    
    Grab the latest versions of the coreutils and gnulib repositories:
        git clone git://git.sv.gnu.org/coreutils
        git clone https://github.com/coreutils/gnulib.git
    
    Move into the coreutils folder, setup the gnulib export, and compile!
        export GNULIB_SRCDIR=/Path/To/gnulib
        ./bootstrap
        ./configure
        make
    
Some notes:

    ./bootstrap
    This file is to get and check other files needed to build the application. 

    ./configureThe configure script is responsible for getting ready to build the software on your 
    specific system. It makes sure all of the dependencies for the rest of the build and install 
    process are available, and finds out whatever it needs to know to use those dependencies.
    Unix programs are often written in C, so we’ll usually need a C compiler to build them. In 
    these cases the configure script will establish that your system does indeed have a C compiler, 
    and find out what it’s called and where to find it.
