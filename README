This repository is used to consolidate all the notes and articles that I commonly need 
on a dail basis. The documents that are in this file are very usefully because all the 
guides online are crap or don't give you every step. These guides do and how / what I 
used inorder to accomplish the tast. I think that these should be avaliable to the public
and if there are any questions then please forward them to me.

As for the scripts folder, the directory obviously is about scripts. There are ones for 
operating systems that have just been installed and I want to set them up quickly. Since
I do a lot of work with virtual machines it is a paint to constantly type all the commands. 
There are even some for setting up lustre as or right now. There will be another README
in that directory.
