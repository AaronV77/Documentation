Welcome! This document will help you learn what Latex is and how to use it quickly,
where as it took me hours to learn all the right stuff. There is a lot of great 
tutorials online but they are either out of date or to complicated for a basic 
tutorial. 

Installation:

    Ubuntu:
        sudo apt-get install texlive-full
        sudo apt-get install gv

    Redhat:
        ?

    Mac:
        ?
    
    Windows:
        ?

How I want this directory to be setup is to have two main directories, one for 
learning Latex and another for all the documents that I have created. The 
tutorial directory will have other directories for each step of the process,
and a document on how to compile the document. The directory for my stuff will 
have the same setup.

Here are the commands I found in order to compile / build the documents so that 
you can view them in a PDF.

    latex "File Name (No extension)"
    dvips "File Name (No extension)"
    gv "File Name".ps 
    ps2pdf "File Name".ps
